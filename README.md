# Classification-of-Handwritten-Digits-Dataset
In this attempt,handwritten digits dataset have been classified into the values 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 by using Support Vector Machine. Classifying the digits recorded the accuracy of 96.38% by using SVM. 

# Preprocessing the dataset
 The data was normalised first. After normalisation, the data is scaled. Since the data is already in grayscale, this spares us from converting the data into grayscale.
 
# Model
The data is split in the ratio 8:2. Radial Basis Function is taken as the kernel. The data is then fit into the model.

# Result
An accuracy of 96.38% is achieved by using SVM.
